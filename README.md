# Tinder Clone / Flutter

## Overview
![](https://i.hizliresim.com/zj3jD7.gif)
This project demonstrates the 2 main scenes of Tinder (openning and the home). It is made to show Flutter's flexibility and smoothness.

## Sources
I've highly used **Matthew Carroll**'s [tinder challenge](https://github.com/matthew-carroll/flutter_ui_challenge_tinder_matching) repo to create this project. Made couple of edits for the sake of compatibility with the upgraded version of Flutter. And changed couple of design aspects to make it more familiar to the Tinder's current version.
